It's just simple Pong Game with hockey design. It's my first try of using OOP and C++. Before this I programmed tasks for my university degree.
Project uses only Raylib library. Nothing difficult don't added to project just basic functionalities and my simple feature of powershot.
Makefile I created only for my MacCook on AppleSilicon. And so, maybe I add Makefiles also for Windows just to understand how Makefiles works
To start game you must compile by just writing "make" and than "./main"

Gameplay:
You playing against simple bot which moves with the ball. And you also can move by key UP to Up and by key DOWN to DOWN. Nothing difficult... Yeah?
Also you can make powershots by pushing key LEFT and ball will speed up every time when you shot powershots. But after 2nd powershot, bot also can make ball
faster to score you a goal, so... be careful.

(I think no one will look at this tiny project so this Readme just for me I think heheh))
